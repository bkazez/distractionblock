# distractionblock

Filter list for AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, and uBlock Origin that attempts to block "sticky" features of web sites. This includes:

* Recommended videos/articles/products/content
* Urgency messaging ("3 items left, etc.)
* Newsletter signup encouragement

In general, any feature that is added to a site based on A/B tests and for the sole purpose of lengthening (or increasing the frequency of) user sessions - or increasing purchase/registration/subscription conversion rates - should be blocked.

The list is currently tailored to my own browsing style, and I would welcome any pull requests or issue reports.
