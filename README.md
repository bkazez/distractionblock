# distractionblock

Filter list for AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, and uBlock Origin that attempts to block "sticky" features of web sites. This includes:

* Recommended videos/articles/products/content
* Urgency messaging (3 rooms left, 25 users are looking at this, etc.)
* Newsletter signup encouragement

My goal is to block any feature that exists mainly to make people come to the site more often, stay longer, or buy more things.

I based the filter list on my own browsing, so please send pull requests or report issues for anything that doesn't work as you expect.
